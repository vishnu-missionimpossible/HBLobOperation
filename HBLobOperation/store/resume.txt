1. In JDBC, Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection();
 
you are telling ConnectionImpl calss is implementing the Connection interface but on seeing the above statment we can say that DriverManager class is implementing because DriverManager is a class and getConnection() is a static method. and Same case applies for Statment interface.


2. In File IO operations session, 

//f.lenght() is of long
char[] ch= new char[(int)f.length()];


3. In 11th dec servlet session, setting up path variable and classpath variable like path= jdk version and classpath is servlet api and in my case jdk is installed in c/programfiles and servlet is present in D/Tomcat 9.0/lib

set path = /bin;
set classpath=.;servlet-api

4. Why HttpServlet class is made as Abstract even though the methods present inside that class are not abstract. and 
if default HttpServlet doXX methods won't execute means why they have written in that way.
